## HTML Notes

HTML is basically the backbone and structure to my startup. I used to think that all the styling and interactivity aspects of a website came from the HTMl but i soon realized that comes with CSS and JavaScripte. The elements are what tell the program what to render while the attributes specify what you want to show. A, img, td, tr, th are just some of the elements. Attributes usually have an equalsign right next to them. I feel more confident after playing around with the codepen in my ability to use HTML.

## CSS Notes

Don't have any for right now.

## Javascript Notes

Most used programming language in the world. "The more effectively you understand JavaScript, the better web programmer you will be." console.log(string) to outupt the string to the debugger console. It looks a lot like c++ (cs 235). End statements with ; and write code in {}. JavaScript to HTML -> script element and the srd attribute. JavaScript can power the entire technology stack. Include the node_modules in the .gitignorefile. Run nmp install first when I clone my source code. I can't seem to run my javascript code. React combines JavaScript and HTML into its component format. Angular component defines what JavaScript, HTML and CSS are combined together. Hierarchy of components.
